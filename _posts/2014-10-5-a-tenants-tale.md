title: A Tenant's Tale

<img class="left" style="margin: 0 1em 1em 0; width:  50%" src="/images/green-door.jpg"/>The best way to put an ear-worm to rest is to actually play it on repeat for a few times.  Likewise with a idea for a website.  The absence of a established review site where tenants could pass on their experiences struck me as a huge anomaly for years.  When I found myself fresh out of <a href="http://www.bravenewtalent.com/">someone else’s startup</a> with some savings in the bank, I decided run with it for a while.

I figured the saw would cut both ways: I’d find out what flaws the idea had and I’d also learn more for myself about the whole process of getting a startup off the ground, including market research, networking, UI development, user testing, pitching - all things that were outside my usual comfort zone.  To summarise everything in one blog post would be impossible and tedious.  After more than a year away - building up my savings again - I’m picking from my bulging Evernote notebook.  I can expand later.

The idea itself was not terribly radical.  I’d first seen something like it in a <a href="%20http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/publications/opening-the-door">Consumer Focus report from 2011</a> and various other places since.  I had also noticed a smattering of sites approaching it but without seeming to gain any traction.  I guessed it was a combination of lack of technical sophistication and effective promotion that stopped them from breaking through.  I’d have to have a swing at it myself to be sure.

To be clear, I was looking for something beyond the regular call for stories from organisations looking to build a story or campaign, e.g. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/interactive/2012/dec/09/renting-property-readers-stories-map">Guardian</a>, <a href="http://londonist.com/2013/08/londoners-tell-us-their-housing-horror-stories.php">Londonist</a> and <a href="http://tellusyourstoryhackney.wordpress.com/">Hackney Renters</a>.  These are always one-off winners, since they only need a few dozen good stories to work, don’t require names to be named, and promise a visible platform.  People like to have their stories heard.

I’m a huge fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">Lean startup methodology</a> and cut every corner to get a 'Minimal Viable Product' up as quickly as possible for early learning. If it took off, I knew I'd throw away the functional prototype and build it for the long term.  User testing by <a href="https://twitter.com/MrChrisEllis">Chris Ellis</a> and other friends helped me rapidly iterate to get the site’s purpose across, make the review process as streamlined as possible and surface any reservations reviewers had.  The result, slightly broken since Google deactivated v2 of their Maps API, can be seen at <a href="tenanttales.com">tenanttales.com</a> if you're curious.  In my defence, I've learnt a bit about front-end frameworks since then...

Alongside this, I went out my way to talk to people.  Tenants and tenant support groups, landlords, lawyers, student unions .  Attended Startup meetups, joined Google Campus.  '<em>TripAdvisor for tenants</em>’ pitch.  Good people like Rayhan of <a href="http://www.wigwamm.com/">Wigwamm</a> and Rajeev of <a href=" http://www.fixflo.com/">FixFlo</a> helped me refine my ideas and my model.  I discovered some organisations are gathering data themselves: Students are particularly vulnerable, having less experience.  Fortunately, they have the student unions of <a href="http://www.sussexstudent.com/rateyourlandlord">Sussex Uni</a>, <a href="http://www.kentunion.co.uk/organisation/10456/">Kent</a> and <a href="http://www.bathstudent.com/pageassets/rateyourrental/Rate-Your-Rental-The-Final-Report.pdf">Bath</a> on the case.

I’m more convinced than ever that direct action - pinning reputation directly on the player - is the only way to straighten the marketplace.  A landlord can generally always fill a property (especially in London) but the level of rent and type of tenant they can get will vary.  Landlords fear nightmare tenants and cherish good ones.  Meanwhile, the situation is only getting worse and I can’t see it being remedied from the top down.  Proposals to apply even the lightest of regulatory touches to the nefarious world of the letting agent have been scuppered by MPs, a good fraction of whom collect rent themselves.

Several months later, I’d learnt a lot and had a great time but was still short of having a self-sustaining service and reluctantly had to switch to full-time contracting.  However, I’m still passionate about the principle of a general rental review site that names names.  It is a challenge, though.  The normal cold-start problem of a review site is further chilled by the potential fear of retaliatory eviction.  Nevertheless, some are still making a go of it and doing a far better job of growing awareness of their service than I could.

<strong>RentalRaters</strong><b> </b><a href="http://rentalraters.com/">rentalraters.com</a> is the newest site to emerge on the scene.  It has done a great job on raising awareness of its service in the mainstream media which is probably crucial to cracking the critical mass problem.

<strong>The Tenants Voice</strong> <a href="http://www.thetenantsvoice.co.uk/">thetenantsvoice.co.uk</a> is a tenant support community with a massive following on Facebook, offering advice, forums and reviews.  It’s also managed to build awareness of itself in the mainstream media.

<strong>AllAgents</strong><b> </b><a href="http://www.allagents.co.uk/">allagents.co.uk</a> is a site specifically for reviewing letting agents.  It’s tighter focus, longer history and close integration with agents themselves has helped it build up an impressive number of reviews.

I'm curious to see how this space pans out and still entertaining ideas about helping to evolve it.  Maybe through some directory extending the three above, or analysis of published data along the lines of <a href="http://labs.shellsi.com/#/agentratings">this experiment</a> - suggestions welcome!
