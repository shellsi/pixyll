In case you wondered, I pronounce ShellSi as ‘shell-sigh’ but feel free to say it how you like.  It comes from a Chinese nickname for Si, written phonetically.  It’s also a useful handle, although the Twitter account is unfortunately taken.  So it goes.

Occasionally, I’ll pop stuff up on here about cool things I’ve discovered, lessons learnt, and anything else that might be useful to others.  Occasionally.
